Also, here's a wild article: [using Jenga to aid therapy](https://sgvcounseling.com/2014/01/27/games-for-therapist-and-parents-jenga-anxieties-and-worries/).  I think I like it.
> Next time you play Jenga, have each player answer one of the following questions each time they pull out a block and successfully places it on the top of the stack.

>- Name one of the things you’re nervous or worried about.
- What do you do when you’re worried?
- Tell about a time when you were worried or nervous, and what happened?
- Name one of your remedies or solutions for feeling nervous or worried?
- Name one thing that happens to your body physically when you get nervous or worried. (i.e. sweating, shaking, etc "nervous ")
